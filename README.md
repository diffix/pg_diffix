# PG Diffix

`pg_diffix` is a PostgreSQL extension for strong dynamic anonymization. It enables you to query your PostgreSQL
database (nearly) as youâ€™re used to, but makes sure you receive fully anonymous output.
For details, visit the [Open Diffix](https://www.open-diffix.org/) website.

Check out the [tutorial](docs/tutorial.md) for an example on how to use `pg_diffix`.
For detailed information on configuring and using the extension, check out the [user guide](docs/user_guide.md).

## Installation

PostgreSQL version 13 or higher is required.

The source is compiled with: `make` or `make TARGET=release` for release version.

You should already have the `postgresql-server-dev-x` package installed if you have postgres version `x`.
If not, you must install it in order to compile the source.

The compiled extension is installed with: `make install`.

You probably need to run it with superuser permission as `sudo make install`.

In `psql`, you have to install the extension with `CREATE EXTENSION pg_diffix;`.

## Using the extension

Load the extension with `LOAD 'pg_diffix';`, unless you configured it to preload using [these instructions](#preloading-the-extension).

Once installed, the extension logs information to `/var/log/postgresql/postgresql-13-main.log` or equivalent.

Node dumps can be formatted to readable form by using `pg_node_formatter`.

## Preloading the extension

To enable automatic activation on every session start, you need to configure
[library preloading](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/runtime-config-client.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-CLIENT-PRELOAD).

In your `postgresql.conf` file, add `pg_diffix` to either of `session_preload_libraries` or `shared_preload_libraries`.

`session_preload_libraries = 'pg_diffix'`

If you have multiple libraries you want to preload, separate them with commas.

## Testing the extension

### `make installcheck`

Once you have a running server with the extension installed, execute `make installcheck` to run the tests.
You must ensure you have all the required permissions for this to succeed, for example:

1. In your `pg_hba.conf` your PostgreSQL superuser to have `trust` authentication `METHOD`.
   If modified, run `systemctl restart postgresql.service` to apply changes.
2. Invoke using `PGUSER=<postgres-superuser> make installcheck`

or if available, just make your usual PostgreSQL user a `SUPERUSER`.

### `PGXN Test Tools`

Or you can use the [PGXN Extension Build and Test Tools](https://github.com/pgxn/docker-pgxn-tools) Docker image:
`docker run -it --rm --mount "type=bind,src=$(pwd),dst=/repo" pgxn/pgxn-tools \
  sh -c 'cd /repo && pg-start 13 && pg-build-test'`.

## Docker images

We provide 2 Docker images preconfigured with the extension.

### Base image

The base image is a standard `postgres` image with `pg_diffix` installed and preloaded.
It does not include any additional database or user out of the box.

The example below shows how to build the image and run a minimally configured container.

Build the image:

`make image`

Run the container in foreground and expose in port 10432:

`docker run --rm --name pg_diffix -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 10432:5432 pg_diffix`

From another shell you can connect to the container via `psql`:

`psql -h localhost -p 10432 -d postgres -U postgres`

For more advanced usage see the [official image reference](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres).

### Demo image

The demo image extends the base image with a sample dataset and a user configured with `publish_trusted` access.

Once started, the container creates and populates the `banking` database.
Three users are created, with password `demo`:
  - `banking` with direct (non-anonymized) access to `banking`
  - `banking_trusted` with anonymized access to `banking` in trusted mode
  - `banking_untrusted` with anonymized access to `banking` untrusted mode

**NOTE** The required file `docker/demo/01-banking-data.sql` is managed by [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com).

Build the image:

`make demo-image`

Run the container in foreground and expose in port 10432:

`docker run --rm --name pg_diffix_demo -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e BANKING_PASSWORD=demo -p 10432:5432 pg_diffix_demo`

Connect to the banking database (from another shell) for anonymized access:

`psql -h localhost -p 10432 -d banking -U banking_trusted`

To keep the container running you can start it in detached mode and with a restart policy:

`docker run -d --name pg_diffix_demo --restart unless-stopped -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
  -e BANKING_PASSWORD=demo -p 10432:5432 pg_diffix_demo`
